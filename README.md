# Dell-XPS-7590-OLED-Linux-Brightness
A simple script to adjust the OLED Brightness of the Dell XPS 15 7590 on Linux.

These scripts can be used to adjust the brightness under Linux for the Dell XPS 15 7590 (only OLED version). This is due to Linux not natively supporting adjusting screen brightness for OLED-Screens.

I created 4 different Scripts, all with 25% brightness increases.

If different brightness levels are wanted, the script can easily be changed by adjusting the last number in the script. (For example if you want 10% brightness, 0.1 needs to be entered)

To run the script, navigate to the script location using cd, set the execute flag by using chmod a+x [Scriptname], and then running it using ./[Scriptname].
